# Simpleton-RAG
A very very basic implementation of a RAG to demonstrate the idea behind RAG.

We use text from the american standard version of the bible to demonstrate how the retrieval can take place.

This is the most simple implementation of a RAG possible so check my GitHub for more efficient and well-built RAG's that are suitable for production level implementation.
